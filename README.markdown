Delayed Action Oscillator model
================================

A simple climate model described in [1].

Abstract (from [1])
> "We study the dynamics of the El Ni˜no phenomenon using the mathematical model of delayedaction oscillator (DAO). Topics such as  the inﬂuence of the annual cycle, global warming, stochastic inﬂuences due to weather conditions and even oﬀ-equatorial heat-sinks can all be discussed using only modest analytical and numerical resources. Thus the DAO allows for a pedagogical introduction
to the science of El Ni˜no and La Ni˜na while at the same time avoiding the need for large-scale computing resources normally associated with much more sophisticated coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. It is an approach which is ideally suited for student projects both at high school and undergraduate level".


Notes
------

* It requires gnuplot installed.
* It depends on [this project](https://github.com/mstn/MultivariateODESolvers).
* It can be opened with Eclipse.
